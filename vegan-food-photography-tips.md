# Vegan food photography tips

## A catering profile filled with high-quality images shows your audience that you're reliable, authentic, and professional.

You donâ€™t need a fancy or expensive camera to take good photos - often your smartphone will do the trick. However, learning some tricks of the food photography trade will set your photos apart no matter what equipment youâ€™re using.

## Basic food photography tips to get you started

### **Use natural light** 

Shooting in natural light brings out colours and harsh shadows and next to a window during the day is a great way to capture natural lighting. Steer clear of overhead lights, lamps or your built-in flash \(please\).

### **Minimize clutter**

Remove all objects inside the frame that donâ€™t support the dish. Fresh ingredients scattered sparingly around the frame works well, however adding cooking utensils or props on top can take the attention away from the dish.

### **Take photos from multiple angles**

Some plates of food look better from above \(like, pizza\), or from the side \(burgers\), or at a 45-degree angle \(drinks\). Try moving around the plate and taking photos at various angles so you can pick your favorite later.

### **Use a tripod**

Keeps your camera steady \(and clean\).

**Edit your photos**

Play around with colour, brightness and white balance to really make the dish â€˜popâ€™. Save your edit presets/settings to use for future photos.
