# FAQ

## **Does the platform only work in Berlin? When will it launch in my city?**

As we kick off yes we are only operating in Berlin. But nothing is forever, and as vegan traveling foodies, we can’t imagine keeping the digital borders up for too long! 

Our software is being developed for international use, so the transition, once the time comes, will be quick and easy!

We will keep our eyes on where demand is highest, but all countries will be considered.  We will launch in English and German first, and add a Spanish translation next. 

## **Why feature only vegan vendors, and not vegetarian ones who offer vegan options?** 

Like you, we know so many vegetarian restaurants and caterers who offer amazing vegan food. However, as our values drive everything we do, we want to shine the brightest light possible on the brave businesses of the world who offer 100% vegan options. 

Endorsing and promoting businesses or industries that make a profit from the suffering of innocent beings \(by using dairy and egg products\) isn’t something we are comfortable with, even if they offer some plant-based options. 

We also want to make sure that there is no possibility of cross-contamination.

## **Can I download it on my phone?**

VEGCRAVER is a PWA \(Progressive Web Application\). You can add a shortcut to your Homescreen for an “app-like” experience on iOS devices. On Android, you should be prompted for an “Install” screen when you use VEGCRAVER more frequently.

## **What payment methods do you support?**

Right now we support all major debit and credit cards \(Mastercard, Visa, American Express, Diners Club and Discover\). We also support digital wallets like Apple Pay and Google Pay on supported devices \(e.g. when you check out from your iPhone or Chrome Browser\). Additionally we support “Sofortüberweisung” \(KLARNA\) and GiroPay.

## **Will my payment details be safe?**

Yes! We are using Stripe as a payment provider. We don’t store any payment information on our side \(like credit card numbers or bank information etc.\). Our partners \(caterers\) have no access to any information regarding payment. All website traffic is encrypted.
